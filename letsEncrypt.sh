####### Requreiments #######

# This script will pull the latest copy of Lets Encrypt and configure it for your JSS
# Please read though the entire script before running this. It is highly recomended
# That you test this on a development envronment before trying in production.

# You must have the following software packages installed:
#	* Git
#	* Java
#	* JSS (Tomcat)

# This script must be run with sudo.

# If you have restrictive firewall rules, port 80 must be open from server out to
# the internet. LetsEncrypt uses port 80 to validate certs. Addiitionally, certs
# may only be renewed every 60-90 days.

####### How to use #######

# 1. Ensure the JSS is running and that you can access the web console
# 2. Review and modify variables below. Stop before the script logic section
# 3. Copy script to JSS server and place in a safe place (not tmp)
# 4. run chmod +x /path/to/letsEncrypt.sh
# 5. run sudo bash /path/to/letsEncrypt.sh
# 6. (Optional) Place in /etc/cron.daily/ for the script to run automatically
#		6.a Change ownership of the file
#		6.b Change file permissions
# 	6.c Remove .sh from script. Validate setup by running: run-parts --test /etc/cron.daily

####### Variables #######

# FQDN of the JSS. This cannot be a .local domain
	DOMAIN="jss.company.com"

# Email address used to sign the cert. Renewal notices will be sent to this address.
	EMAIL="you@domain.com"

# be changed if JSS was manually installed or if there is a different verison of
# Tomcat.
